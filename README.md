# Hyper-V-VM-Template

This repository contains PowerShell scripts designed to automate and simplify the process of creating Hyper-V VM templates.

The goal is to save time, reduce errors, and ensure consistency by eliminating the need for repetitive configuration changes and performance tweaks.

Since I perform extensive research and testing, I often work with a variety of virtual machines (VMs) that are built and rebuilt frequently. As a result, I primarily deploy them from a pre-configured template (base or golden image).

Currently, this repository includes the following PowerShell scripts:

- **Deploy-BgInfo-WS2012-R2.ps1**
